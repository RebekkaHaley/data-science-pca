## Welcome
This repo contains code to calculate Principle Components Analysis (PCA) using numpy and python classes.

## Principle Components Analysis (PCA)
Principal component analysis (PCA) is a statistical technique used to analyse large data sets with high dimensionality or features per observation. It can be used to reduce dimensionality, or to determine and rank feature importance.

The process of computing PCA involves calculating the principle components.
