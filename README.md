## Welcome
This repo contains code to calculate Principle Components Analysis (PCA) using numpy and python classes.

## Principle Components Analysis (PCA)
Principal component analysis (PCA) a statistical technique used to analyse large data sets with high dimensionality or features per observation. It can be used to reduce dimensionality of such a data set, or to determine and rank the feature importance.

The process of computing PCA involves calculating the principle components.
